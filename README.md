## Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Purpose of the project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. This Repository Containg the R code and the code book for the Getting and cleaning Data course project.
The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
The Task is as follows
create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
## FILES
* run_analysis.R: The R Code to generate a tidy Data set from the conditions given in 5 steps above
* CodeBook.md: describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
* tidy.txt: The final cleaned file.
